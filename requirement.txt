## E-Commerce Platform Requirements

### **Project Overview**
The project is to build a scalable e-commerce platform using React (Next.js) for the frontend and Node.js (with Prisma ORM and MySQL) for the backend. The platform will cater to B2B, B2C, retailers, and wholesalers, specifically selling female business shirts. Initially, the website will serve as a product catalog with a "Find a Store" feature instead of a shopping cart. The platform will support multiple sales channels, multilingual support, and geolocation-based experiences.
